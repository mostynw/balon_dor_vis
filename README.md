# balon_dor_vis

Small and simple project, web-scraping Balon D'or points from 2009-2019 and manipulating and visualising of the voting points using Excel.

Originally a Python project but found it easier in Excel. May have to revisit in Python and see if I can get the red average line to be coded into the graphic instead of hand-drawn afterwards, which caused mis-alignments went converting to pdf.
